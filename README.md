Effective moderation of hate speech on social media is critical to maintaining healthy online communities. This study introduces an engagement-aware scoring system to enhance hate speech detection and prioritization. Using a dataset of 291 posts and their associated comments mined from the Reddit community "r/PoliticalDiscussion," we constructed a directed user interaction graph and scored posts using the Bertweet model. To address ambiguities in hate speech detection, we developed a composite scoring approach that integrates content-level hate scores, user-level aggregated scores, and graph-based neighborhood influences. Evaluation against a baseline Bertweet model, using Spearman correlation and human-labeled metrics, demonstrated that our system outperforms the baseline in ranking hateful content. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging user interactions and graph-based modeling to improve the prioritization of harmful content for moderation.
